This project provides the schema for the backend of a swiss tournament app and the associated tests. It was created as part of Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree. 

##Dependencies
* [Python V2.7.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/) (different versions may work, but use at your own risk)
* [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) (Python Library)
* [bleach](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach)  (Python Library, not to be confused with the cleaning agent)
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)

##Installation
STEPS:

2. Create a database named "tournament" ([instructions can be found here](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/tutorial-createdb.html)).
3. Import tournament.sql into the tournament database.
4. Run tournament_test.py to make sure all tests pass.
